## About Me

Hello, thank you for visiting my personal website. I’m a PhD Student in the OELE Lab at Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof. Gautam Biswas.

My research focuses on multimodal learning analytics, computer vision, and machine learning. Recently, my work has centered on scaling learning analytics based on eye-tracking to provide teachers and students with insightful and actionable analytics to enhance their educational experiences.
