Hello, I'm Eduardo Davalos and take you for visiting my personal website. I'm a PhD Student in the [OELE Lab](https://wp0.vanderbilt.edu/oele/) at Vanderbilt University, advised by Prof. [Guatam Biswas](https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/bio/?pid=gautam-biswas).

My research focuses on multimodal learning analytics, computer vision, and machine learning. My recent work focuses on scaling learning analytics, based on eye-tracking, and providing teachers and students insightful and actionable analytics to help their educational experience.

I received my bachelor and master's degree in Electrical Engineering at St. Mary's University in 2020. During these time, my work focused on rigid 6D pose estimation on monocular videos with Prof. [Mehran Aminian](https://www.stmarytx.edu/academics/faculty/mehran-aminian/).
